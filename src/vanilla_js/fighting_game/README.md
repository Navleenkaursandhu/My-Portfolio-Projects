# STREET FIGHTING GAME
Want to play something exciting? Try this 1-on-1 fighting game with your friend on your computer using your keyboard.

The rules are pretty simple. The game has 3 rounds in total. To start the game Player A takes the first round followed by player B and so forth. It will be the player's choice whether he/she wants to hit the opponent or take a lifeline during his/her round (remember there is no point of taking a lifeline in your first round as it's already 100%). On hit, opponents health will reduce by a random number (the damage will be reflected by red bar) and on selecting lifeline the current player's health increases by random number (health is reflected by green bar). After 3rd round the player with good health wins the battle.

Please note that in order to play this game you need to press your keyboard alphabets to take actions during fight.
