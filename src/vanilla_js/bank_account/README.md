# BANK ACCOUNT
Take a glimpse of this simple bank account App. The user can define the amount to be deposited or withdrawn and, with a single click, the customers account balance is adjusted automatically. If the user tries to withdraw unrealistic amount higher than their account balance then the app displays an error message stating that the user can not withdraw the desired amount.
