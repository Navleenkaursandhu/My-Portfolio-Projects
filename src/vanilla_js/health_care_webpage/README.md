HEALTH CARE WEBPAGE 
Had a great experience building this static health care web App. This App was my first ever proper project. Working on this project not only boosted my confidence to code but also served as a stepping stone towards achieving my goal of becoming a web developer. None of the elements do anything because no javascript was used in this project.
