# GUESS THE WORD GAME
This is a classic word game where the goal is to simply find the hidden word.
You will be presented with a number of blank spaces representing the missing letters you need to find.

Use the keyboard to guess a letter (Hint: I recommend starting with vowels).
If your chosen letter exists in the hidden word, then all the blanks where that letter appears will be revealed.After you've revealed several letters, you may be able to guess what the answer is and fill in the remaining letters.

Be warned, every time you guess a wrong letter you loose one out of 16 lifelines. If you're a fan of word puzzles, make sure you check this out.
