# LOGIN WEB PAGE
This project is a simple demonstration of a static login page comprising of various interactable elements like input fields, buttons and links. None of the elements do anything because no javascript was used in this project. However, this project was invaluable in giving greater confidence while learning foundational HTML and CSS skills.

## SKILLS: 
- HTML
- CSS
- Git
- Github
- VS Code
- Responsive Web Design
