CARD MATCH GAME
Level up your concentration with this online memory card game App. Start the game by flipping a card.
Then try to find another card that has the same number and color as the first. The cards with same number
and color make a pair (such as 2 of hearts and 2 of diamonds will make a pair). If you can't find a pair, the flipped
cards will be flipped back with the face down. Try to remember these images as it becomes easier to find pairs
the longer you play. When you find a pair the cards will face up from the board and when you find all the pairs,
you have completed the game. This game is a great exercise to train your memory in a playful way and most
of you, will love playing this card matching game.
