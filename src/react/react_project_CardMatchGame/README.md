# CARD MATCH GAME
Level up your concentration with this online memory card game App. Start the game by flipping a card.
  
Try to find pairs with matching numbers and colors. The cards with same number
and color make a pair (such as 2 of hearts and 2 of diamonds will make a pair). If you can&apos;t find a pair,
the cards are flipped back face down. Remember the images and use your memory to find pairs as you progress
through the game. When you find a pair, the cards will remain facing up on the board. The game ends once all
pairs are found. 

Try out this game as this fun and interactive app is a great way to exercise your memory skills.
