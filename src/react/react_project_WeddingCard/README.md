# WEDDING CARD APPLICATION
Wouldn't it be great if we could create our own wedding cards whenever and wherever you want? 

So, with the same thought I came up with this Wedding Card App, where all you need to do is select one of the many available templates, enter family details, wedding day details, pre-wedding event details, and post-wedding event details. The data in the template updates live as you enter the data allowing you to create your own wedding card in no time.

The app stores the information you entered locally so that you do not have to enter it again when you come back to this web page. This app respects the user's privacy and no information is sent to or stored on an external server.
