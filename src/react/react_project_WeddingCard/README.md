WEDDING CARD APPLICATION
Whats better than choosing your own wedding card template
whenever and wherever you want! So, with the same thought I came up with this Wedding Card App,
where all you need to do is select template of your choice, enter family details, wedding day details,
pre-wedding event details followed by post-wedding event details and finally without much hassel you
have created your own wedding card in no time. The platform uses Local Storage where the information does not get sent to any server thus offering privacy to the end users and the data will not be deleted when the browser is closed, and will be available the next day, week, or year.

SKILLS: React, Vite, JS, TailwindCSS, HTML, Local Storage API, ESLint, Git, Github, VSCode, Responsive Web Design
