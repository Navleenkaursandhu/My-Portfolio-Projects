# FIGHTING GAME
Want to play something exciting? Try out this 1-on-1 fighting game with your friend on a computer.

The rules are pretty simple. The game has 5 rounds in total. To start the game Player A takes the first round followed
by player B and so forth. It will be the player&apos;s choice whether he/she wants to hit the opponent or take a lifeline
during his/her round (remember there is no point of taking a lifeline in your first round as it&apos;s already 100%). On
hit, opponents health will reduce by a random number (the damage will be reflected by red bar) and on selecting lifeline
the current player&apos;s health increases by random number (health is reflected by green bar). In the final round the player
with good health wins the battle.
