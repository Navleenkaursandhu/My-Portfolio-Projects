# PORTFOLIO
This portfolio is a showcase of my project and my journey as a Front-End Web Developer.
This website provides easy access to my projects along with a link to the source code for 
each project. The entire UI was designed and coded by myself and the images were all created 
using an open source digital art application named Krita. Through my personal projects I was 
able to gradually learn the best coding practices and gain invaluable experience in web development 
and creating delightful UI/UX desgins.
