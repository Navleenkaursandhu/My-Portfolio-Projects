# TIC TAC TOE GAME
Put away your pencil and paper - now you can play Tic Tac Toe on your computer using this App. This game is played on a 3x3 grid.

Each player's goal is to make 3 in a row. You are X, your friend is O. You and your friend will take turns placing your mark, X or O, on an available square in the grid. Think on your feet but also be careful, as the first player to make
3 of their own mark in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game! If all 9 squares are filled and neither player has 3 in a row, the game is considered a tie.
